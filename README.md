### Hi there 👋

My name is Marcio Pancheri from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Java Developer since 2000. Three years ago I started to study ReactJS and React Native and more recently, Ruby and Elixir.

In my free time, I like to play games (Dark Souls and Demon's Souls) (🎮), to watch movies (🎞️) and TV shows (📺), to listen music (🎵), to ride a bike (🚵) and eventually I like to drink a beer (🍺) with my friends.
